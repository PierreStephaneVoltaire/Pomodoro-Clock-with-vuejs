## Concept
`The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros`(Pomodoro Technique. (2017, November 08). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique )
